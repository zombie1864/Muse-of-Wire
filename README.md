# Muse-of-Wire
A MERN project developed by Jeff Varela, Matthew Greer, and Rob Kornblum

Muse of Wire is a website that invites admirers of the arts. Our mission is to deliver digital art and video to users that want to explore the world through the imagination of the human mind. 
To accomplish this, users will have access to a few artworks and videos for free. Users can sign up with an account that will give them access to all the content provided by Muse of Wire. Users can also identify as one of three types of users, general account - has viewing access to all the content, student account - will have access to content that is sutable to minors, and a creator account - user can upload content to the website. Future implementation will include the ability for creators to livestream performing arts. 

Technologies used is MondoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. For video streaming content reactPlayer API is used. Future technologies will be added to integrate live streaming capabilities.
